This repo is straight from the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/react-native/en/get-started/) template for React Native with a few tweaks.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Get the code**

    ```shell
    # Clone the repo
    git clone https://github.com/nathan-dunn/storybook-demo.git
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies**

    ```shell
    # Navigate to the directory
    cd storybook-demo

    # Install the dependencies
    yarn
    ```

    You might get some errors. Try running it before you worry about troubleshooting.

3.  **Run it**

```shell
# Run storybook
yarn storybook:ios
```

or

```shell
# Run the app (spoiler alert: there is nothing to see here)
yarn ios
```

#### 🗒️ Note

If you are used to using storybook in web, you might be surprised to see that the storybook is not running in the browser. It is running in the simulator 📱.
